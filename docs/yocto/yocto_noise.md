# Yocto/Noise: Tiny library of noise functions used in graphics applications.

Yocto/Noise provides a Perlin noise implementation for now. This library will
grow as a collection of noise functions used in procedural modeling.

1. use `perlin_noise()` to generate Perlin noise with optional wrapping
2. use `perlin_ridge()`, `perlin_fbm()` and `perlin_turbulence()` for fractal
   noises
