# ToDo V5

## Infrastructure

- Docs

## Ndarrays

- decide on extents comparing to other languages
- range with sentinel
- image generation as ndarrays
- textures as ndarrays
- consider vecs for ndarrays
- remove constructor that takes multiple indices
- potentially specialize arrays for 1d, 2d, 3d case

## Ndspan

- provide ndspans for ndarrays after testing that it works better than 
  span/vector in generic code
