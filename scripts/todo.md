# ToDo V5

## Infrastructure

- Docs

## IO

- remove non-exceptions

## Math

- vecs use c array
- vecs as arrays

## Ndarrays

- decide on extents comparing to other languages
- range with sentinel
- textures as ndarrays
- potentially specialize arrays for 1d, 2d, 3d case

## Ndspan

- provide ndspans for ndarrays after testing that it works better than
  span/vector in generic code
